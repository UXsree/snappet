cypress test

How to run the test: 

1.download/clone the code
2. do an npm install
3. give npm run opency in the console from the same folder structure.

addSubject.spec.js assumes there are no subjects by the name "Spelling". hence before running, it should be cleared if we have one in the dashboard.
